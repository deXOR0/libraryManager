So a few disclaimer,

This is not a sophisticated program or anything, its just something that comes to my mind one day, and I do it for fun.

Taking that into account, you can immediately see the flaws,

1. It does not have a save feature whatsoever, any changes you made on one session will not be saved, and therefore you lose some progress.
2. The admin account details are HARDCODED, major security flaws, i know
3. It is not functional on any scale in my opinion. It should be connected to somekind of database. But it wasn't even implemented.

Basically I just implemented everything that I know from my 6 months journey into Java programming.

I am still working on ironing out the issues in my spare time though.

Any feedbacks are welcome :)

Thank you

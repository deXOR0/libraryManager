So a few disclaimer,

This is not a sophisticated program or anything, its just something that came to my mind one day, and I did it for fun.

Taking that into account, you can immediately see the flaws,

1. It does not have a save feature whatsoever, any changes you made on one session will not be saved, and therefore you lose all of your progress.
2. The admin account details are HARDCODED, major security flaws, I know
3. It is not functional on any scale whatsoever. It should be connected to somekind of database. But I didn't implement it.

Basically I just implemented everything that I know from my 6 months journey of Java programming.

I am still working on ironing out the issues in my spare time though.

Any feedbacks are welcome :)

Thank you
